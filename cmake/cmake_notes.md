# CMake Notes

## CMake Variables
### Source
http://www.cmake.org/Wiki/CMake_Useful_Variables

### Variables
PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
: contains the full path to the root of your project source directory, i.e. to
  the nearest directory where CMakeLists.txt contains the PROJECT() command

PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
: contains the full path to the top level directory of your build tree

## Basic example
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.6)
project (Tutorial)
add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cpp)
```

## Adding a version number and configured header file
```cmake
cmake_minimum_required (VERSION 2.6)
project (Tutorial)
# The version number.
set (Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR 1)
set (Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR 0)

# configure a header file to pass some of the CMake settings
# to the source code
configure_file (
  "${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/TutorialConfig.h.in"
  "${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/TutorialConfig.h"
  )

# add the binary tree to the search path for include files
# so that we will find TutorialConfig.h
include_directories("${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}")

# add the executable
add_executable(Tutorial tutorial.cxx)
```

And then, in TutorialConfig.h,
```cpp
// the configured options and settings for Tutorial
#define Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR @Tutorial_VERSION_MAJOR@
#define Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR @Tutorial_VERSION_MINOR@
```

In tutorial.cpp file, you can now add
```cpp
#include "TutorialConfig.h"
```

## Adding a library
Now we will add a library to our project. This library will contain our own
implementation for computing the square root of a number. The executable can
then use this library instead of the standard square root function provided by
the compiler. For this tutorial we will put the library into a subdirectory
called MathFunctions. It will have the following one line CMakeLists file:

```cmake
add_library(MathFunctions mysqrt.cxx)
```
To make use of the new library we add an add_subdirectory call in the top level
CMakeLists file so that the library will get built. We also add another include
directory so that the MathFunctions/mysqrt.h header file can be found for the
function prototype. The last change is to add the new library to the executable.
The last few lines of the top level CMakeLists file now look like:

```cmake
# Find MathFunctions/mysqrt.h
include_directories ("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/MathFunctions")

# Added so that library gets built
add_subdirectory (MathFunctions)

# add the executable
add_executable (Tutorial tutorial.cpp)
target_link_libraries (Tutorial MathFunctions)
```

Now let us consider making the MathFunctions library optional. In this tutorial
there really isnâ€™t any reason to do so, but with larger libraries or libraries
that rely on third party code you might want to. The first step is to add an
option to the top level CMakeLists file.

```cmake
# should we use our own math functions?
option (USE_MYMATH
        "Use tutorial provided math implementation" ON)
```

```cmake
# add the MathFunctions library?
if (USE_MYMATH)
  include_directories ("${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/MathFunctions")
  add_subdirectory (MathFunctions)
  set (EXTRA_LIBS ${EXTRA_LIBS} MathFunctions)
endif (USE_MYMATH)

# add the executable
add_executable (Tutorial tutorial.cxx)
target_link_libraries (Tutorial  ${EXTRA_LIBS})
```

In the source code:
```cpp
#ifdef USE_MYMATH
#include "MathFunctions.h"
#endif
```

In the source code we make use of USE_MYMATH as well. This is provided from
CMake to the source code through the TutorialConfig.h.in configured file by
adding the following line to it:

```cpp
#cmakedefine USE_MYMATH
```
